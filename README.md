## Setting up a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Follow these steps to set up and activate your virtual environment:

1.  **Create the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

After activation, your terminal prompt should show `(.venv)` indicating that the virtual environment is active.
